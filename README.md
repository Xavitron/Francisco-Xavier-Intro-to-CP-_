Intro to CP 
I started this program with the Idea of creating a game that was similar to the Light-Bike game from the movie Tron.
I wasn't sure if I could complete this project in time because I was not sure of my programing skils.
At the begining, I started from what Mr.Cozort had programed in my Nineth.py, this was only a two player game that had two turtles Michallengelo and Mikey that moved around
This step took me a week to code, because I was having problems with my visual studios 
After this I started looking for ways that I could add boundaries in the game
And after this I had to find a way to kill the enemy 
I saw that I had to restart the project because I was not being able to fit the forms that I was finding for how to kill an enemy in the code that I created
I copied the code form https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45093430/tron-game-collision-turtle-python, because I saw that the code that they had could be efective and that I was going to be able to work with
I tried this code and it worked
I started changing the way that the turtles moved, I changed the speed that the turtles went at, I changed the background, and added the borders to the game

At the end the game that I started in mind with was very similar to the game that I ended with. Even do I would had like to do a little bit more with my code, I am satisfied with the result that I ended with.
I could had been more effective on times, but I finished on time with a result wich I am very proud of.
